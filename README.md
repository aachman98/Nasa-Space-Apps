## Nasa Space Jockey Virtual Experience
The virtual experience of International Space Station (ISS) and 18 Satellites of Earth by our game Space Jockey. We have come to a solution in which the player can interact with space satellites launched by NASA and also permits him/her to venture around and inside the international space station of NASA. 
Inspiring for a newbie kid just starting to know about space and satellites and an important resource for earth scientists, Space Jockey’s ultimate user experience is a game you look forward to.

1. It gives you a virtually real look of our planet Earth and the sattelites revolving around it along with the outer space with utmost accuracy and abstractness. 
2. It also allows one to realize the relative size of planets and sattelites in the outer space. If such interesting graphical simulations weren’t enough, we delve deeper to the DATA side of the space by exploring, accounting and displaying the data involved. The major attraction of the Space Jockey is the virtually real view of the International space station both from inside and outside. We can observe and talk to the astraunauts enabling us to gather information about their ongoing mission.

All of this happens as the player swirls around because of the gravity free zone thus creating greater influence and major experience enhancer.All in all, Space Jockey is not just a game but an enabler. It inspires a newbie fueling his curiosity. It also showcases the debris in the space, its accumulation and creating awareness about how humans are adding junk to the outer space as well so that we can go about creating a debris-less space! A graphically rich, advance information wise and virtually real – Space Jockey isn’t just a game but a space enabler!Also, we are concerned to raise the overall space awareness of the user by showcasing them the drastic climate changes and their harmful effects.
